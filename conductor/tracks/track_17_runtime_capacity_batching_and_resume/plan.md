# Plan - Runtime Capacity, Batching, And Resume

## Tasks
- [x] Estimate disk required for raw files, normalized records, Parquet, manifests, and annual archive staging.
- [x] Decide whether first full bootstrap runs locally, on GitHub Actions, or on another controlled runner.
- [x] Define batch size and pacing defaults for first full sync.
- [x] Confirm sync state is preserved between batches.
- [ ] Confirm interrupted Hugging Face uploads can resume without corrupting the remote dataset. Blocked until `HF_TOKEN`, `HF_REPO_ID`, and a live dataset are available.
- [x] Add an operator note for cleaning local generated data safely after upload and verification.
- [x] Record the fallback plan if the full bootstrap exceeds GitHub Actions timeout.

## Implementation Notes
- Added `docs/runtime_capacity_runbook.md` with disk budget, runner decision, batch defaults, resume behavior, Hugging Face upload rerun guidance, cleanup rules, and GitHub Actions timeout fallback.
- Linked the runtime capacity runbook from `README.md` and `docs/maintenance_runbook.md`.
- Added `tests/test_sync_resume.py` to prove staged sync runs preserve and extend `data/_state/sync_state.json` without external credentials.
- First full bootstrap runner decision: controlled local or self-hosted runner for the initial complete corpus; GitHub Actions remains the daily/latest maintenance loop after the first verified upload.
- Conservative disk budget: reserve at least 25 GB free for the expected 6 GB class corpus; prefer 50 GB if archive staging or embeddings run on the same host. Final measured disk usage remains blocked until Track 07 produces the full corpus.
