# Project Tracks

This file tracks the major work items for `corpus-legislation-nz`.

---

## Status Key

- `todo`: not started.
- `blocked`: waiting on credentials, external access, or a decision.
- `ready`: prerequisites are available and implementation can proceed.
- `in_progress`: actively being worked.
- `done`: acceptance criteria are met and evidence is recorded.

## Reconciliation Note - 2026-06-10

The approved partial/API-discovery launch is complete. GitHub repository
publication, required secrets/variables, live Hugging Face publication, Zenodo
production DOI publication, release/tag creation, and post-launch rename to
`corpus-legislation-nz` have been verified.

Remaining blockers are now scoped to full-corpus completeness, long-running
historical coverage, scheduled maintenance evidence, and roadmap tracks. Older
track text that refers to missing GitHub remotes, missing public Hugging Face
shells, or absent launch secrets should be read as superseded by this
reconciliation unless the individual track still preserves a full-completeness
blocker.

## Track 01 - Repository Commit And Release Baseline

Status: `done`

Goal: get the current local implementation into a clean Git baseline before any live data operation is treated as repeatable.

Actions:

- Resolve the parent `OneDrive - Flinders` Git root lock issue or move `corpus-law-nz` into an isolated Git repository.
- Commit the currently staged rate-limit hardening, bootstrap guardrails, tests, and documentation.
- Generate a clean `uv.lock` from the final repository root.
- Switch CI dependency installation to `uv sync --all-extras --frozen` after `uv.lock` exists.
- Run `pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests`.
- Run `ruff check src/nz_legislation_corpus tests`.

Acceptance criteria:

- Git history contains a commit for the rate-limit work.
- `uv.lock` is committed.
- Tests and lint pass from the clean checkout.

Evidence to record:

- Commit SHA.
- Test command output summary.
- Lint command output summary.

## Track 02 - Credential And Secret Inventory

Status: `done`

Goal: confirm all credentials and GitHub variables required for live corpus operations are present, scoped correctly, and stored in the right place.

Actions:

- Confirm `NZ_LEGISLATION_API_KEY` exists and can call the NZ Legislation API.
- Confirm `HF_TOKEN` exists and has write access only to the intended Hugging Face dataset repository where possible.
- Confirm `HF_REPO_ID` is final.
- Confirm `ZENODO_TOKEN` exists for sandbox first.
- Decide whether production Zenodo uses a separate token and required reviewer environment.
- Store GitHub secrets: `NZ_LEGISLATION_API_KEY`, `HF_TOKEN`, and `ZENODO_TOKEN`.
- Store GitHub variables: `HF_REPO_ID`, `NZLC_SEARCH_TERMS`, `NZLC_SEARCH_FIELD`, `NZLC_SEARCH_SORT_BY`, `NZLC_LEGISLATION_TYPES`, `ARCHIVE_CREATORS_JSON`, and archive metadata.
- Run `uv run nzlc doctor` locally or through GitHub Actions.

Acceptance criteria:

- `nzlc doctor` passes without exposing secret values.
- GitHub Actions has the required secrets and variables.
- Zenodo production publication remains approval-gated.

Evidence recorded:

- GitHub repository secrets exist by name: `NZ_LEGISLATION_API_KEY`,
  `HF_TOKEN`, and `ZENODO_TOKEN`.
- GitHub repository variables include `HF_REPO_ID=edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz`
  and `HF_HISTORICAL_REPO_ID=edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz-historical`,
  plus archive and NZLC search variables.
- Branch protection on `main` requires strict `tests`, one approving review,
  admin enforcement, linear history, no force pushes, and no deletions.

## Track 03 - Hugging Face Dataset Shell

Status: `done`

Goal: create and verify the Hugging Face dataset repository before uploading corpus data.

Actions:

- Create or confirm the Hugging Face dataset repository named by `HF_REPO_ID`.
- Run `scripts/create_huggingface_dataset_repo.sh "$HF_REPO_ID"` or equivalent API setup.
- Confirm the remote layout is root-based, not nested under `data/`.
- Confirm `.gitattributes`, dataset card metadata, and lightweight root placeholders are correct.
- Remove any legacy `data/...` placeholders if present.

Acceptance criteria:

- Hugging Face repo exists and is writable by the configured token.
- Root-level layout is ready for `parquet/`, `raw_xml/`, `manifests/`, and `_state/`.
- Dataset card describes live corpus status without claiming full coverage before discovery proof.

Evidence to record:

- Hugging Face repo URL.
- Root layout listing.
- Dataset card revision or commit hash.

Current evidence:

- Live Hugging Face dataset:
  `https://huggingface.co/datasets/edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz`.
- Current verified revision:
  `6b082e2f85802cb374898d689d264017a047799b`.
- Dataset is public and has root-level publication artifacts.
- Legacy DOI-bound Hugging Face dataset
  `edithatogo/nz-legislation-corpus` remains as a compatibility shell pointing
  to the renamed dataset.

## Track 04 - Source Discovery Completeness

Status: `done`

Goal: establish the discovery method needed before the project can claim a complete corpus.

Actions:

- Contact or check the NZ Legislation source for an official work ID export or complete inventory.
- If no official export is available, build `seeds/work_ids.txt` from a documented authoritative inventory.
- Keep comments and provenance in the seed file or adjacent documentation.
- Reconcile seed coverage against search-based discovery.
- Define expected counts by legislation type, status, and year where available.
- Document any known exclusions, ephemeral IDs, or incorporated-by-reference caveats.

Acceptance criteria:

- `seeds/work_ids.txt` or an equivalent documented inventory exists.
- `docs/source_discovery_strategy.md` states the actual discovery source used.
- Public docs distinguish pipeline completeness from proven corpus completeness.

Current evidence:

- `seeds/work_ids.txt` created from search-derived candidate inventory (33,693 work IDs) with provenance header.
- Seed source: search-based API discovery with terms `act,bill,regulation,order,notice` and types `act,bill,secondary_legislation,amendment_paper` (no status filter). Discovery run: `27313765016`.
- Seed SHA-256: `4E9BD99F2D9EF3AB57C9BBD24DBA9DEAC3E3F98A0E30C4572001E189BDAC0C74`.
- Reconciliation against reviewed historical batch 0001 (500 IDs): 33,193 added, 0 removed â€” search-derived inventory is a superset.
- Expected counts by type: act (16,829), secondary_legislation (12,226), amendment_paper (2,764), bill (1,874).
- Caveat: search-derived inventory is not authoritative; public docs (README, DATASET_CARD, source_discovery_strategy) state coverage is not proven complete.

## Track 05 - Conservative Live Smoke Sync

Status: `done`

Goal: prove the live sync path against external services without risking rate limits or large uploads.

Actions:

- Set `NZLC_MIN_SECONDS_BETWEEN_REQUESTS=1.0`.
- Run `uv run nzlc sync --seed-work-ids seeds/work_ids.txt --max-works 5`.
- Run `uv run nzlc validate`.
- Run `uv run nzlc manifest`.
- Run `uv run nzlc coverage-report`.
- Inspect `data/_state/sync_state.json`, `data/manifests/latest_manifest.json`, and `data/manifests/latest_changes.json`.

Acceptance criteria:

- Five or fewer seed works are synced exactly as requested.
- Validation passes.
- Manifest and coverage report are generated.
- No rate-limit failures are unhandled.

Evidence to record:

- Command summaries.
- Synced work count.
- Any API warnings from sync state.

Current evidence:

- Live partial/API-discovery sync path was proven for the approved launch.
- The full seed inventory remains absent, so this track is complete only for the
  conservative launch smoke scope. Full coverage remains blocked under Tracks
  04, 07, 08, and 11.

## Track 06 - First Hugging Face Smoke Upload

Status: `done`

Goal: prove upload, restore, and no-change behavior on Hugging Face with the small smoke corpus.

Actions:

- Run `uv run nzlc hf-upload` against the smoke data.
- Download the Hugging Face dataset back into a clean local `data/` directory.
- Confirm root-level remote files map to local `data/parquet/`, `data/raw_xml/`, `data/manifests/`, and `data/_state/`.
- Rerun upload with unchanged content and confirm it skips or produces no content churn.
- Inspect the Hugging Face dataset viewer and sample Parquet reads.

Acceptance criteria:

- Smoke corpus is visible in Hugging Face.
- Re-download produces the expected local layout.
- No-change upload behavior is proven.

Evidence to record:

- Hugging Face commit or revision.
- Manifest hash before and after no-change upload.
- Sample Parquet read result.

Current evidence:

- The live Hugging Face upload, restore/no-change behavior, and sample dataset
  verification passed for the approved partial/API-discovery launch.
- Live dataset target:
  `https://huggingface.co/datasets/edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz`.
- Current verified revision:
  `6b082e2f85802cb374898d689d264017a047799b`.

## Track 07 - Full Corpus Bootstrap Download

Status: `in_progress`

Goal: download the full corpus into local `data/` using the proven discovery method and conservative pacing.

Actions:

- Confirm enough local disk space for raw files, Parquet, manifests, and temporary archive work.
- Restore current Hugging Face corpus state into `data/` if any previous upload exists.
- Run full seed sync with `NZLC_MIN_SECONDS_BETWEEN_REQUESTS` set conservatively.
- Use staged batches if the seed inventory is large or API limits are uncertain.
- Preserve sync state after each batch.
- Run `uv run nzlc validate`, `uv run nzlc manifest`, and `uv run nzlc coverage-report`.
- Review missing text, missing XML URLs, failed versions, and ephemeral identifiers.

Acceptance criteria:

- All seed works are attempted.
- Failed versions are recorded and triaged.
- Validation passes or documented exceptions are accepted.
- Coverage report is reviewed before any public completeness claim.

Evidence to record:

- Total works attempted.
- Total versions and records produced.
- Failed or skipped version list.
- Final manifest hash.
- Coverage report path.

Current state:

- `seeds/work_ids.txt` exists (33,693 work IDs, Track 04). Root blocker resolved.
- 68 pre-split batches available in `generated/historical-discovery-27313765016/batches/`.
- Historical batches 0001-0003 confirmed-uploaded to `edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz-historical`.
- Batch 0004 no-upload triggered: run `27362894765`.
- Full bootstrap workflow is now present in `.github/workflows/full_corpus_bootstrap.yml`.
- Full corpus operations runbook is now documented in `docs/full_corpus_operations.md`.
- Full sync must run via GitHub Actions (no local API key; local disk ~7.5 GB free).
- Runner disk budget: 25 GB min, 50 GB preferred (docs/runtime_capacity_runbook.md).

## Track 08 - Full Hugging Face Corpus Upload

Status: `ready`

Goal: publish the full validated corpus to Hugging Face as the live operational dataset.

Actions:

- Confirm `HF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE=1` for the upload environment.
- Run `uv run nzlc hf-upload`.
- Use resumable upload behavior if the upload is interrupted.
- Verify Hugging Face contains `parquet/`, `raw_xml/`, `records.jsonl`, `manifests/`, and `_state/` as expected.
- Re-download the dataset into a clean location and compare manifest hashes.
- Confirm the dataset card states the discovery and coverage status accurately.

Acceptance criteria:

- Full corpus upload completes.
- Re-downloaded manifest matches the uploaded manifest.
- Dataset card and README do not overclaim completeness.

Evidence to record:

- Hugging Face revision or commit hash.
- Uploaded size.
- Manifest hash.
- Re-download verification result.

Current blocker:

- A live partial/API-discovery Hugging Face dataset exists, but the full
  validated corpus has not been produced.
- Track 07 has not produced the full bootstrap corpus yet.
- The upload helper defaults `HF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE=1` during upload.
- Full-corpus upload workflow is now present in
  `.github/workflows/full_corpus_hf_upload.yml`.
- Full corpus operations runbook is now documented in
  `docs/full_corpus_operations.md`.

## Track 09 - GitHub Scheduled Hugging Face Sync

Status: `ready`

Goal: make GitHub Actions the normal maintenance loop for the Hugging Face live corpus.

Actions:

- Confirm `.github/workflows/hf_sync.yml` exists on the default branch.
- Configure GitHub secrets and variables from Track 02.
- Run workflow manually with `max_works=5` and `min_seconds_between_requests=1.0`.
- Run workflow manually without `max_works` only after Track 07 and Track 08 are proven.
- Confirm scheduled daily runs restore Hugging Face state before syncing.
- Confirm workflow uploads only changed content.
- Confirm GitHub Actions summary includes sync state and latest changes.

Acceptance criteria:

- Manual smoke workflow passes.
- Full manual workflow passes.
- Daily scheduled workflow is enabled and uses the Hugging Face repo as the live data hub.

Evidence to record:

- GitHub Actions run URLs.
- Workflow inputs used.
- Latest successful scheduled run URL.

Current evidence and remaining blocker:

- `.github/workflows/hf_sync.yml` exists locally and includes schedule, manual dispatch inputs, Hugging Face restore, sync, upload, and step-summary sections.
- The GitHub repository and required secrets/variables exist.
- Manual live sync and no-change upload proof passed for the approved
  partial/API-discovery launch.
- The scheduled-run launch gate was explicitly waived by the repository owner on
  2026-06-09 after the first post-fix scheduled event did not dispatch.
- Full and recurring maintenance proof remains blocked until Tracks 04, 07, and
  08 establish a full seed and full validated corpus.

## Track 10 - Maintenance Doctor And Alerting

Status: `done`

Goal: surface token, API, and dependency failures before they affect the live corpus.

Actions:

- Enable `.github/workflows/doctor.yml`.
- Confirm doctor runs without mutating corpus data.
- Confirm GitHub Actions notifications reach the maintainer.
- Decide whether to add a lightweight webhook or issue creation on repeated failures.
- Review Dependabot configuration and security workflows.

Acceptance criteria:

- Doctor workflow passes once with live secrets.
- Failure notification path is known.
- Maintainer has a weekly check routine.

Evidence to record:

- Doctor workflow run URL.
- Notification destination.
- Any follow-up alerting issue.

Current evidence:

- `.github/workflows/doctor.yml` exists and is scheduled weekly.
- Local non-network `uv run --no-cache nzlc doctor` runs without creating
  `data/`.
- Live secret/variable configuration exists; continuing evidence should be
  recorded through future weekly doctor runs.
- Dependabot, CodeQL, and OpenSSF Scorecard configurations exist locally.
- Doctor workflow passed with live secrets: run `27125139848` (2026-06-08) and
  run `27362180628` (2026-06-11) both succeeded.
- Notification path: GitHub Actions default email notifications to repository
  watchers on scheduled workflow failure. Weekly check routine documented in
  `docs/maintenance_runbook.md`.

## Track 11 - Monthly Full Reconciliation

Status: `ready`

Goal: keep the corpus complete over time, not only during the first bootstrap.

Actions:

- Define a monthly or quarterly full reconciliation cadence.
- Compare seed inventory, search discovery, and coverage report outputs.
- Add newly discovered work IDs to `seeds/work_ids.txt` with provenance.
- Rerun full sync in staged batches when the seed file changes materially.
- Review counts by legislation type, status, and year.

Acceptance criteria:

- Reconciliation cadence is documented.
- Seed changes are reviewed.
- Coverage deltas are explained in `latest_changes.json` or a maintenance note.

Evidence to record:

- Reconciliation date.
- Added or removed work IDs.
- Coverage deltas.

Current blocker:

- `docs/reconciliation_runbook.md` now documents the monthly cadence and procedure.
- `seeds/work_ids.txt` is absent, so seed changes cannot be reviewed or applied.
- `data/manifests/coverage_report.json` is absent, so coverage deltas cannot be compared.
- Tracks 04, 07, 08, and 09 remain blocked, so no full corpus or scheduled maintenance loop exists yet to reconcile.
- Candidate seed reconciliation is now available through `nzlc reconcile-work-ids`
  and `.github/workflows/historical_seed_reconciliation.yml`.
- Monthly full reconciliation automation is now also present in
  `.github/workflows/monthly_full_reconciliation.yml` for the broader full-corpus
  maintenance lane.
- Full corpus operations runbook is now documented in
  `docs/full_corpus_operations.md`.

Status: `done`

Goal: prove annual immutable archiving without publishing to production.

Actions:

- Set Zenodo sandbox token and sandbox API URL.
- Run `uv run nzlc archive --year <year> --output-dir dist/archive`.
- Run `uv run nzlc zenodo-upload --year <year> --archive-dir dist/archive` against sandbox.
- Verify archive manifest and checksums.
- Verify duplicate-file replacement behavior if rerun.

Acceptance criteria:

- Sandbox draft is created or updated.
- Archive, manifest, and checksum files are present.
- No production publication occurs.

Evidence to record:

- Sandbox deposition URL.
- Archive filename and checksum.
- Workflow run URL if performed in GitHub Actions.

Current evidence:

- Production Zenodo path was proven and published for the approved partial
  launch, superseding the original sandbox-only blocker.
- Published record: `https://zenodo.org/records/20592540`.
- DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.20592540`.
- Concept DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.20592539`.

## Track 13 - Protected Production Zenodo Archive

Status: `done`

Goal: publish annual DOI snapshots only after explicit approval.

Actions:

- Configure `zenodo-production` GitHub environment with required reviewers.
- Confirm production `ZENODO_TOKEN` is environment-scoped.
- Run annual workflow with `publish=false` first.
- Review production draft metadata, license, creators, related identifiers, and files.
- Publish only after reviewer approval and explicit `publish=true`.
- Record DOI in `CITATION.cff`, `DATASET_CARD.md`, and Hugging Face dataset card.

Acceptance criteria:

- Production draft path is proven.
- Publication requires approval.
- DOI is recorded after publication.

Evidence to record:

- Production deposition URL.
- DOI.
- Commit updating citation files.

Current evidence:

- Production Zenodo archive published for the approved partial launch:
  `https://zenodo.org/records/20592540`.
- DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.20592540`.
- Workflow evidence:
  `https://github.com/edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz/actions/runs/27132519663`.
- The Zenodo related identifier now points to
  `https://huggingface.co/datasets/edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz`.
- Published archive filenames remain immutable and still include the old launch
  prefix.

## Track 14 - Legal, Citation, And Dataset Wording

Status: `done`

Goal: keep public statements accurate about corpus coverage, licensing, and incorporated-by-reference material.

Actions:

- Review `README.md`, `DATASET_CARD.md`, `CITATION.cff`, and archive metadata.
- State whether discovery is complete, partial, seed-based, or search-based.
- Separate code license from legislation reuse status.
- Add caveats for incorporated-by-reference material and non-legislative website content.
- Confirm citation guidance for Hugging Face live data and Zenodo annual snapshots.

Acceptance criteria:

- Public docs make no unsupported completeness claim.
- License and citation wording are internally consistent.
- Zenodo and Hugging Face metadata align.

Evidence to record:

- Reviewed files.
- Reviewer notes.
- Metadata commit SHA.

Current evidence:

- Reviewed `README.md`, `DATASET_CARD.md`, `CITATION.cff`, and Hugging Face dataset-card generation in `scripts/init_huggingface_dataset.py`.
- Public wording now states coverage is not proven complete, separates code licensing from source-content reuse status, and distinguishes live Hugging Face citation from fixed Zenodo citation.
- Official NZ Legislation copyright/disclosure pages checked on 2026-06-07 support Crown copyright / Creative Commons attribution wording, with separate caution retained for third-party or non-legislative material.
- Live Hugging Face and Zenodo metadata were verified for the approved
  partial/API-discovery launch and post-launch rename.
- Full-coverage wording remains prohibited until Track 04 is closed.

## Track 15 - Downstream Researcher Usability

Status: `done`

Goal: make the published corpus easy to inspect and query after the live hub is stable.

Actions:

- Add a small public sample split if useful for users who do not want the full corpus.
- Add DuckDB or Polars examples that query Parquet directly from Hugging Face.
- Add a minimal data dictionary from schema fields.
- Optionally add a Hugging Face Space for browsing/search after core maintenance is stable.

Acceptance criteria:

- A new user can query the Parquet dataset without downloading the full raw corpus.
- Examples are tested or manually verified.
- Optional browser UI is clearly secondary to the dataset pipeline.

Evidence to record:

- Example command output.
- Sample dataset path or revision.
- Documentation links.

Current evidence:

- Added `docs/researcher_quickstart.md` with DuckDB `hf://` examples, local PyArrow examples, and sample split policy.
- Added `docs/data_dictionary.md` from `schemas/legislation_record.schema.json`.
- `README.md` and `DATASET_CARD.md` now link to downstream researcher documentation.
- Examples verified on 2026-06-11:
  - DuckDB `hf://` queries return 9 records from live dataset.
  - PyArrow example fixed to avoid pandas dependency; verified with local smoke fixture.
  - Local smoke fixture + validate commands produce viable Parquet output.
- Sample split deferred until full corpus publication (Track 08).
- Hugging Face Space deferred until pipeline and live hub are stable.

## Track 16 - GitHub Repository Hardening

Status: `done`

Goal: make the GitHub repository safe to operate as the automation controller for the live Hugging Face corpus.

Actions:

- Create or confirm the final GitHub repository. Blocked: no Git remote is configured.
- Push the code-only repository without `data/`, `dist/`, cache directories, or generated corpus files. Blocked until the final GitHub repository exists.
- Enable branch protection on the default branch. Blocked until the final GitHub repository exists.
- Require the tests workflow before merge once CI is stable. Blocked until branch protection/rulesets can be applied on GitHub.
- Enable secret scanning and push protection where available. Blocked until GitHub repository settings are available.
- Enable Dependabot alerts and dependency update PRs. Dependency update PR configuration is present in `.github/dependabot.yml`; live alert enablement is scripted but blocked until GitHub repository settings are available.
- Confirm `CODEOWNERS`, issue templates, pull request template, security policy, and contribution docs are present if the repo is public. Done locally.
- Confirm workflows have minimum permissions and do not expose secrets in logs. Done locally.

Acceptance criteria:

- Default branch is protected.
- Tests are required for code changes.
- Secret scanning and dependency alerts are enabled or explicitly documented as unavailable.
- Repository remains code-only.

Evidence to record:

- GitHub repository URL.
- Branch protection summary.
- Enabled security settings.
- First passing CI run URL.

Current evidence:

- GitHub repository URL: `https://github.com/edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz`.
- Branch protection summary: `main` requires strict `tests`, one approving review, admin enforcement, linear history, no force pushes, and no deletions.
- Enabled security settings: Dependabot security updates, secret scanning, and push protection.
- First passing CI run: baseline `Tests` run `27087158077` and `CodeQL` run `27087158073` passed on 2026-06-07.
- `.gitignore` excludes generated corpus/archive/cache paths including `data/`, `dist/`, `.hf_cache/`, and `.track15-smoke/`; no tracked files exist under generated corpus/archive paths.
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, pull request template, issue templates, Dependabot config, CodeQL, Scorecard, tests, doctor, Hugging Face sync, and annual Zenodo workflows are present.
- Workflow permissions are minimum-scoped for local review: `contents: read` by default, with `security-events: write` only where `codeql.yml` and `scorecard.yml` upload SARIF.

## Track 17 - Runtime Capacity, Batching, And Resume

Status: `done`

Goal: make the full corpus bootstrap and recurring sync practical under local disk, GitHub Actions runtime, API rate limits, and upload interruption constraints.

Actions:

- Estimate disk required for raw files, normalized records, Parquet, manifests, and annual archive staging. Done in `docs/runtime_capacity_runbook.md`.
- Decide whether first full bootstrap runs locally, on GitHub Actions, or on another controlled runner. Done: first full bootstrap should run on a controlled local or self-hosted runner.
- Define batch size and pacing defaults for first full sync. Done in `docs/runtime_capacity_runbook.md`.
- Confirm sync state is preserved between batches. Done with `tests/test_sync_resume.py`.
- Confirm interrupted Hugging Face uploads can resume without corrupting the remote dataset. `hf upload-large-folder` is resumable by design; no-change manifest check prevents redundant uploads; sync resume tested.
- Add an operator note for cleaning local generated data safely after upload and verification. Done in `docs/runtime_capacity_runbook.md`.
- Record the fallback plan if the full bootstrap exceeds GitHub Actions timeout. Done in `docs/runtime_capacity_runbook.md`.

Acceptance criteria:

- Bootstrap runner and disk budget are documented.
- Batch/resume procedure is written and tested with a non-trivial batch.
- Generated local data cleanup is documented and does not affect Git-tracked files.

Evidence to record:

- Disk estimate.
- Chosen runner.
- Batch size and pacing values.
- Resume test result.

Current evidence:

- Disk estimate documented in `docs/runtime_capacity_runbook.md`: reserve at least 25 GB free for the expected 6 GB class corpus, preferably 50 GB when archive staging or embeddings share the runner.
- Chosen runner documented: controlled local or self-hosted first bootstrap, then GitHub Actions for daily/latest maintenance after first verified upload.
- Batch defaults documented: 5-work smoke at 1.0 seconds pacing, 50-work pilot at 1.0 seconds, 250-work seed chunks at 0.5 seconds, and 500-1000 work chunks at 0.2 seconds only after throttle-free earlier batches.
- Sync resume behavior tested in `tests/test_sync_resume.py` (2 tests pass).
- Hugging Face upload resume uses `hf upload-large-folder` (resumable) with
  no-change manifest check, documented in `docs/runtime_capacity_runbook.md`.
- Historical bootstrap publication proved the manual upload path at 500-work
  scale. Full-corpus capacity remains to be measured once the authoritative seed
  is available.

## Track 18 - Data Quality And Schema Governance

Status: `blocked`

Goal: prevent silent schema drift or degraded corpus quality after the first public upload.

Actions:

- Define minimum validation checks required before upload. Done.
- Define which validation warnings block upload and which are informational. Done.
- Add or confirm fixture coverage for representative XML, HTML, missing-text, missing-format, and ephemeral-ID cases. Done.
- Version the record schema explicitly before public release. Done: `record_schema_version = "1.0"`.
- Document how schema changes are migrated or announced. Done in `docs/schema_governance.md`.
- Track data-quality metrics from `coverage_report.json` over time. Done via `data/manifests/coverage_history.jsonl`.

Acceptance criteria:

- Upload cannot proceed after blocking validation failures.
- Schema version is visible in records or manifests.
- Coverage metrics can be compared between runs.
- Public docs explain backward compatibility expectations.

Evidence to record:

- Schema version.
- Validation report path.
- Fixture list.
- Coverage baseline.

Current evidence:

- Schema version: `record_schema_version = "1.0"`.
- Validation report path: `data/manifests/validation_report.json`.
- Fixture list: `tests/fixtures/sample_legislation.xml`, `tests/fixtures/sample_legislation.html`, plus validation tests for missing text, missing XML URL, missing source format/metadata-only content, and ephemeral identifiers.
- Coverage metrics are written to `data/manifests/coverage_report.json` and appended to `data/manifests/coverage_history.jsonl`.
- Live coverage baseline remains blocked until Track 07/08 produce and publish the real corpus.

## Track 19 - Public Launch Decision

Status: `done`

Goal: make a deliberate launch decision after the corpus, automation, metadata, and maintenance loop are all proven.

Actions:

- Confirm Tracks 01 through 14 are done or explicitly waived. Blocked: Tracks 02-14 still have unresolved blockers.
- Confirm Hugging Face contains the full intended live corpus or clearly labels the dataset as partial. Blocked until Track 03/08 publish or confirm the live dataset.
- Confirm GitHub scheduled sync is enabled and has passed after the first upload. Blocked until Track 09 runs on a configured GitHub repository.
- Confirm Zenodo sandbox archive has passed. Blocked until Track 12 passes.
- Confirm public README, dataset card, and citation files match the actual coverage state. Done for current prelaunch state.
- Create a release note summarizing coverage, caveats, update cadence, and archival plan. Done as draft template.

Acceptance criteria:

- Public users can find the live dataset, source repository, coverage statement, and citation instructions.
- No public page claims full coverage unless Track 04 is proven.
- Maintainer has a clear monthly and annual operating checklist.

Evidence to record:

- Launch date.
- Hugging Face revision.
- GitHub release or tag.
- Final launch checklist.

Current evidence:

- Launch date: 2026-06-09; current decision is launch approved for the
  intentional partial/API-discovery dataset.
- Hugging Face revision:
  `6b082e2f85802cb374898d689d264017a047799b` after the post-launch rename and

## Track 20 - GitHub Release Tag For Partial Launch

Status: `done`

Goal: create a GitHub release and tag for the approved intentional partial/API-discovery launch.

Actions:

- Confirm `docs/public_launch_decision.md` records launch approval and the scheduled-run waiver.
- Choose a release tag, for example `v0.1.0-partial.20260609`.
- Create a GitHub release on `main` for the partial/API-discovery dataset launch.
- Update `docs/public_launch_decision.md` so `GitHub release or tag` records the real tag.
- Confirm release notes do not claim full New Zealand legislation coverage.

Acceptance criteria:

- A GitHub release/tag exists for the approved partial launch.
- Launch docs record the release/tag.
- Public wording remains clear that the dataset is partial/API-discovery based.

Evidence to record:

- GitHub release URL:
  `https://github.com/edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz/releases/tag/v0.1.0-partial.20260609`.
- Tag name and commit SHA: `v0.1.0-partial.20260609` at
  `3196fb415276e1d1e8edd3c394ddeac30d4485a9`.
- Commit updating launch docs: this implementation branch records the release
  URL in `docs/public_launch_decision.md`.

## Track 21 - Separate Historical Hugging Face Corpus

Status: `done`

Goal: prepare historical corpus publication as a separate Hugging Face dataset, following the Hansard-style separation pattern and avoiding overwrite of the live six-record dataset.

Actions:

- Use the separate Hugging Face dataset target `edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz-historical`.
- Document that `edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz` remains the live partial/API-discovery dataset.
- Confirm or create the historical Hugging Face dataset shell with root-level layout.
- Configure a separate repository variable such as `HF_HISTORICAL_REPO_ID`.
- Ensure historical pilots and uploads cannot write to `HF_REPO_ID` unless explicitly intended.

Acceptance criteria:

- Historical publication target is documented and separate from the live dataset.
- Historical dataset shell exists or has a precise creation runbook.
- Repository variables/secrets distinguish live and historical upload targets.

Evidence to record:

- Historical Hugging Face dataset URL.
- Root layout or creation command output.
- GitHub variable names, not secret values.

Completion evidence:

- Historical target documented as `edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz-historical`.
- Live target `edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz` remains the partial/API-discovery corpus and must not be overwritten.
- GitHub variable contract documented as `HF_HISTORICAL_REPO_ID=edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz-historical`.

## Track 22 - Historical Bootstrap Review Plan

Status: `done`

Goal: turn the historical pilot into a reviewed bootstrap plan before any historical publication workflow is enabled.

Actions:

- Retrieve the latest `historical-sync-pilot` artifact produced by a
  `historical_sync_pilot.yml` workflow run.
- Review `generated/historical-work-ids.provenance.json`.
- Review `data-historical-pilot/manifests/latest_manifest.json`.
- Review `data-historical-pilot/manifests/coverage_report.json`.
- Review `data-historical-pilot/_state/sync_state.json`, including failed-version state.
- Define batch sizes, pacing, resume checkpoints, and stop conditions for the historical bootstrap.
- Record the chosen publication target from Track 21.

Acceptance criteria:

- Pilot artifact evidence is reviewed and summarized.
- Failed versions and coverage caveats are documented.
- Batch plan and publication target are approved before upload code is added.

Evidence to record:

- Pilot workflow run URL and artifact name:
  `https://github.com/edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz/actions/runs/27138352849`,
  artifact `historical-sync-pilot`.
- Work ID count, record count, manifest hash, and coverage summary: reviewed in
  `docs/historical_bootstrap_review.md`; 10 work IDs, 52 validated records,
  manifest SHA-256
  `3a6e6abdccaa6a8124fece672a708a8f6e61389cd32b575ccc13367a5d23b0ae`.
- Failed-version summary: `records_failed: 0`, warnings empty, 52 version hash
  entries available for resume.
- Batch plan and historical Hugging Face target: documented in
  `docs/historical_bootstrap_review.md`; target
  `edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz-historical`.

## Track 23 - Manual Historical Upload Workflow

Status: `done`

Goal: add a disabled/manual historical upload workflow only after the historical target and bootstrap plan are explicit.

Actions:

- Wait for Track 21 to define the separate historical Hugging Face target.
- Wait for Track 22 to approve pilot evidence, batch sizes, and publication policy.
- Add a manual-only workflow separate from `hf_sync.yml`.
- Require an explicit `HF_HISTORICAL_REPO_ID` repository variable or workflow input.
- Fail closed if `HF_HISTORICAL_REPO_ID` is absent or equals `HF_REPO_ID`.
- Keep historical upload disabled for schedules unless a later track deliberately enables maintenance automation.
- Default to dry-run/no-upload behavior until the historical target and batch plan are approved.
- Add guardrails preventing writes to the live `HF_REPO_ID` by default.

Acceptance criteria:

- Historical upload workflow is manual-only and separate from live sync.
- Workflow fails closed unless the historical target is explicitly configured.
- Workflow rejects `HF_HISTORICAL_REPO_ID=HF_REPO_ID`.
- Workflow has no scheduled trigger.
- Dry-run/no-upload behavior is documented for first proof runs.
- Documentation states that historical outputs must not overwrite the live dataset.

Evidence to record:

- Pull request URL adding the workflow.
- Dry-run or no-upload workflow run URL.
- First reviewed historical upload run URL, only after Track 21 and Track 22 pass.

Remaining external evidence:

- First reviewed historical upload run URL remains intentionally pending until
  historical target and batch-plan review are approved.

Current evidence:

- `docs/HUGGINGFACE_SETUP.md` records the manual historical upload contract:
  distinct `HF_HISTORICAL_REPO_ID`, fail-closed target checks, no schedule, and
  dry-run/no-upload first proof.
- `docs/historical_publication_policy.md` records the publication guardrails
  that protect the live `HF_REPO_ID` dataset from historical writes by default.
- `.github/workflows/historical_hf_upload.yml` adds a separate manual-only
  workflow with `workflow_dispatch`, fail-closed `HF_HISTORICAL_REPO_ID`
  checks, dry-run artifacts, and an upload step gated by
  `upload_confirmed=true`.
- `.github/workflows/historical_batch_review.yml` adds a GitHub-hosted
  reviewed batch fan-out path for parallel no-upload validation while keeping
  confirmed historical uploads on the serial workflow.
- `scripts/historical_workflow_helpers.py` centralizes the historical target
  guard, reviewed-seed provenance, and publication-policy metadata used by the
  shell initializer, serial upload workflow, and batch review workflow.
- Dry-run/no-upload proof passed:
  `https://github.com/edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz/actions/runs/27194196559`.
  The upload step was skipped because `upload_confirmed=false`, and dry-run
  artifacts were uploaded.
- `conductor/tracks/track_23_manual_historical_upload_workflow/spec.md`
  records the workflow contract.
- `conductor/tracks/track_23_manual_historical_upload_workflow/plan.md`
  records the implementation and local verification state.
- Historical completeness planning now uses `nzlc reconcile-work-ids`,
  `.github/workflows/historical_seed_reconciliation.yml`, and
  `docs/historical_completeness_plan.md` before any full-seed promotion.

## Track 24 - Corpus Family Naming And Publication Alignment

Status: `done`

Goal: adopt `corpus-nz-legislation` as the preferred systematic label and align GitHub, Hugging Face, Zenodo, OSF, and future metadata environments with sibling `corpus-nz-hansard`.

Actions:

- Record naming preference in Conductor setup and corpus-family docs.
- Audit GitHub, Hugging Face, Zenodo, OSF, and future metadata environments.
- Cross-reference `C:\Users\60217257\OneDrive - Flinders\repos\corpus-nz-hansard`.
- Preserve existing public URLs until a migration plan protects citations and redirects.

Acceptance criteria:

- Requirements, design, Mermaid diagrams, and environment tasks exist.
- Track directory contains spec and plan.
- Public-surface alignment includes GitHub, Hugging Face, Zenodo, OSF, and future metadata.

- README and dataset card now state the preferred `corpus-nz-legislation`
  family label, current `corpus-legislation-nz` publication line, and sibling
  `corpus-nz-hansard`.
- Migration or reservation of `corpus-nz-legislation` remains deferred to Track
  28.

## Track 25 - Cross Corpus Interoperability And Metadata

Status: `done`

Goal: adopt applicable Hansard interoperability and SOTA metadata roadmap patterns for legislation researcher artifacts and metadata endpoints.

Actions:

- Review Hansard search/RAG, RDF, Akoma Ntoso, and metadata endpoint tracks.
- Define optional legislation DuckDB/search/RAG and metadata artifacts.
- Keep derived artifacts validated, versioned, and optional.

Acceptance criteria:

- Roadmap covers DuckDB/search/RAG, Croissant, RO-Crate, Frictionless, DCAT/PROV-O, and Akoma Ntoso considerations.
- Track directory contains spec and plan.
- No base dependency expansion happens without a future implementation track.

Link: `conductor/tracks/track_25_cross_corpus_interoperability_and_metadata/`

Evidence:

- Hansard interoperability mapping:
  `docs/cross_corpus_interoperability_hansard.md`.
- Corpus-family design and researcher quickstart now reference the optional
  interoperability artifact contract.
- Hansard reference checkout:
  `C:\Users\60217257\OneDrive - Flinders\repos\corpus-nz-hansard`.
- Derived artifacts remain optional, generated, versioned, validated, and
  dependency-neutral until future implementation tracks scope them.

  `npx --yes zenodraft --help`.
- Metadata validation passed with
  `npx --yes zenodraft metadata validate docs/zenodo/zenodo-2026-metadata.example.json`.
- The annual Zenodo workflow remains draft-first by default, with future
  `zenodraft` token mapping documented and production publish still protected.


## track 28 github repository name migration assessment

Status: `done`

Goal: Assess safe migration or reservation of the preferred corpus-nz-legislation GitHub name.

Link: `conductor/tracks/track_28_github_repository_name_migration_assessment/`

Evidence:

- Assessment document:
  `docs/github_repository_name_migration_assessment.md`.
- Current live GitHub repository remains
  `https://github.com/edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz`.
- Preferred target `edithatogo/corpus-nz-legislation` was not found or not
  accessible through `gh repo view` at the Track 28 check point.
- Decision: do not rename the live repository in this track; reserve the
  preferred name as a pointer repository first, then treat any full rename as a
  release operation with post-rename verification.


## track 29 shared nz corpus core schema

Status: `done`

Goal: Define shared core fields and compatibility expectations across legislation and Hansard.

- The shared schema accepts `corpus-nz-legislation` and `corpus-nz-hansard`
  while keeping corpus-specific fields in their own schemas.


## track 30 sota metadata packages

Status: `done`

Goal: Generate validated Croissant, RO-Crate, Frictionless, DCAT, and PROV-O metadata packages.

Link: `conductor/tracks/track_30_sota_metadata_packages/`

Evidence:

- CI enforcement:
  `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs the version/release consistency check with
  read-only repository permissions.
- Release Please decision: deferred until publication gates and protected
  environments are proven; future automation must not publish Hugging Face or
  Zenodo records.
- Dependency-update policy keeps Renovate PRs from publishing datasets or
  Zenodo records.


## track 32 sota cicd code quality rust tooling

Status: `done`

Goal: Adopt SOTA CI/code-quality automation using Rust-backed tools where possible: uv, ruff, typos, zizmor, taplo, plus actionlint.

  down to GitHub's 10-input `workflow_dispatch` limit.
- CodeQL, OpenSSF Scorecard, Renovate, and pre-commit adoption decisions are
  documented.
- `zizmor` is adopted as an advisory CI job until the existing unpinned-action
  and template-expansion findings are resolved in a workflow-hardening pass.


## track 33 artifact provenance attestations

Status: `done`

Goal: Add release evidence ledgers, GitHub artifact attestations or SLSA-style provenance, and signed/checksummed artifact policy.
