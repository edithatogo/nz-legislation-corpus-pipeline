# Contracts

## Environment contract

Required for live sync:

- `NZ_LEGISLATION_API_KEY`
- `HF_TOKEN`
- `HF_REPO_ID`

Required for annual archive:

- `ZENODO_TOKEN`
- `ARCHIVE_CREATORS_JSON`

Required for Zenodo sandbox proof if `ZENODO_TOKEN` is production-scoped:

- `ZENODO_SANDBOX_TOKEN`

Optional:

- `ZENODO_DEPOSITION_ID`
- `ZENODO_API_URL`
- `ARCHIVE_LICENSE`
- `NZLC_SEARCH_TERMS`
- `NZLC_SEARCH_FIELD`
- `NZLC_OUTPUT_DIR`

## CLI contract

- `nzlc doctor`: validate configuration.
- `nzlc sync`: build corpus from official API.
- `nzlc validate`: validate records and write validation report.
- `nzlc manifest`: write manifest and change report.
- `nzlc hf-upload`: upload live corpus to Hugging Face.
- `nzlc archive`: create annual archive and checksums.
- `nzlc zenodo-upload`: create/update Zenodo draft and optionally publish.
- `nzlc smoke-fixture`: generate a local one-record corpus for tests.

## Record contract

Every record must satisfy `schemas/legislation_record.schema.json` and include stable identifiers, source URLs, status/type metadata, extracted text, hashes, and pipeline provenance.

## Artifact contract

Live Hugging Face layout:

```text
data/
  records.jsonl
  parquet/legislation_type=<type>/year=<year>/part-00000.parquet
  raw_xml/<stable_id>.xml
  manifests/latest_manifest.json
  manifests/latest_changes.json
```

Annual archive layout:

```text
dist/archive/
  corpus-legislation-nz-YYYY.tar.zst
  corpus-legislation-nz-YYYY.manifest.json
  corpus-legislation-nz-YYYY.release-evidence.json
  corpus-legislation-nz-YYYY.SHA256SUMS.txt
```

The release evidence file records repository commit, workflow run, publication
target, manifest hash, schema version, record count, coverage statement, and
artifact checksums. GitHub Actions archive builds generate GitHub artifact
attestations before Zenodo draft upload.

## Safety contract

- Do not commit corpus data to GitHub.
- Do not publish Zenodo automatically unless `publish=true` is explicitly passed.
- Do not print secrets.
- Do not delete published Zenodo records.
- Do not claim corpus completeness until discovery coverage is proven.


## Manifest stability contract

`content_sha256` is the canonical no-change comparison value for live uploads. It is based only on stable corpus files: path, size, SHA-256, and record count. It deliberately excludes generated timestamps, manifests, `_state`, cache directories, and bytecode.

`manifest_sha256` is a diagnostic hash for the manifest payload. Do not use local run timestamps to decide whether to upload.

## Coverage contract

`nzlc coverage-report` must be run before public claims about corpus scope. A public release must state whether discovery used:

1. a seed work-id list,
2. API search coverage,
3. an official bulk export, or
4. a reconciliation of the above.

## Zenodraft requirement

Future Zenodo draft/archive workflow changes should use or formally evaluate https://github.com/zenodraft/zenodraft. Use sandbox first, validate .zenodo.json metadata, map tokens to ZENODO_ACCESS_TOKEN or ZENODO_SANDBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN only inside the relevant CI step, and keep publish commands behind protected reviewer approval.
